            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>FInding a Pamphlet scattered abroad, called a Treatise of Tithes, mentioned to be written by a Wall-wisher to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and <hi>Propriety,</hi> (his Name being not therein mentioned) and the same touching upon some things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in a former small <hi>Treatise</hi> or <hi>Tract of Tithes</hi> published by friends of ours, together with the <hi>Supply</hi> to a Draught of a great <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Systeme</hi> concerning the <hi>Regulation</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> We have thought it convenient to put all (whom it concerneth) further in mind what is the just right concerning this Subject (the greatest Numbers of them and us having nothing out of which Tithes have been used to be paid) not doubting but to make it appear to all unbyased Persons, wherein those (who writ, or caused to be written, that Treatise after theirs) fail in Well-wishing to <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Propriety:</hi> Upon which Reasons (in nature of a <hi>Reply</hi> to his) as we shall now shew for that purpose, we will tender an <hi>Issue</hi> (conceiving that the Gentleman, who drew the same, shewed as much as in such Case can be to cause a bad matter to seem good) to which he may <hi>Joyn</hi> if he please; which if he shall not, but <hi>Rejoyn</hi> by alleging new matter; if he hath any considerable (which we think he hath not) so soon as we shall hear thereof, we shall very speedily <hi>Surrejoyn</hi> to the same, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that the most Honourable <hi>Legislators</hi> of this Nation will do equall right in the premisses.</p>

            <p>THe Gentleman is much mistaken in the Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses he writeth of concerning the Duty of Tithes; for there is not any of the best of the Learned Histories written concerning Tithes but question the duty thereof, to such as of late years have taken and exacted the same; and he is as much mistaken in the submittance to the payment of them, for if he had pleased to have taken notice what they our friends had written concerning the same in their Treatise thereof, (to which we refer the Reader) and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them in order, and not snatched at some things, and leapt over others (which doe clearly manifest the most part of his Treatise to be untrue, and merely feigned) he should have found there <hi>Page</hi> 23, 24, 26, 34. what dispute hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the payment thereof; and how the same have been extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted injuriously, and some of the People blindly lead into, and besotted in the Duty of Payment thereof; and how the same (<hi>Page</hi> the 27, 28, 31, 34.) have been mispent and turned unto wrong and wicked Uses, instead of Pious maintenance of the Ministry and the Poor (for which Uses those which have paid the same were first induced thereunto) But after, as they have shewn in their Treatise (<hi>Page</hi> 27, 28, 31, 34.) the same hath been mispent. And (<hi>Page</hi> 26) the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

And how can Women, Children, or; &amp;c. be such Stewards<note n="*" place="margin">And if it shall please God to put into the Minds of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Country Jury-men, both Grand and others, to take notice of such <hi>Mis-user, Dis-user,</hi> and <hi>Non-user,</hi> and so to advise and take good and solid advise thereof: that if any of them proved by any person (who shall be sued for Tith) they shall come truly to understand &amp; conceive the same a forfeiture as aforesaid, which we think they may very well do, the Gent. having not at all spake to, or mentioned the <hi>Mis-using, Non-using,</hi> or <hi>Dis-using</hi> in those our Friends Treatise expressed; but tacitly admitted the same as therein is set forth; and all others hitherto have been silent therein (general silence to Matters of great Concernment being accounted consent thereunto) Then what will become of the <hi>Impropriators</hi> Tith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And therefore we wonder that the writer of this last Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise should affirm that Appropriators (or as we conceive he meaneth <hi>Impropriators</hi>) should have as good right to Tithes as any Purchaser to his Purchased Freehold. And besides For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures may happen of Freehold, Purchased Lands by <hi>Bien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> Cessation of payment of Chief Rent, and no distresse found on those Lands: and as for the Cessation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent maintenance of the Ministry and Relief of the Poor by most of the Fith-takers for many years last past is too apparent over all this Nation; (There formerly having been several Endships belonging to great Parishes, the Tithes of most of which (being of much greater yearly <hi>value</hi> than of all the other Parishes in this Nation) have been <hi>Appropriated,</hi> and Priests to serve the Cure in most of those Endships: But the Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have banished away and left to starve all Ministers Vicars and others (whom they ought to maintain to serve such Cures) by means wherof the People in such great Parishes have for the most part been ignorant in Religion, but only some of them, who have repaired to small Parishes to hear Sermons, where most commonly best Preachers and Preaching have been.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:33673:3"/>
            <p>And yet this Gentleman is so incharitable as to alleage this age to be ignorant and avaritious; and the People Clamorous, Malicious, and Mercilesse; for which we can imagin he neither hath nor can have any other cause, than that (to the grief of the <hi>Impropriators</hi>) this Age hath discovered the Dotage of former Ages in holding Tithes of Conscience to be Due; which every one may well inform himself to be quite contrary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">

But for Tithes to be taken &amp; imployed as in their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise (<hi>Page</hi> 27, 28, 29.) is expressed, and the Poor in every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish where such usage hath been not at all relieved by them, nor the Ministers afforded Competent or comfortable allowance for which Tithes originally were, and now are in Equity (and in Law as we conceive) only due for the reasons shewed in their Treatise (<hi>Page</hi> 23, 24, 26.34.) but for ought hath been had of such Tith-takers the Poor might have starved, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple run into <hi>Heathenism</hi> for want of Preaching and Teaching of true doctrine, as they have at large expressed in their said Treatise (<hi>Page</hi> 27, 28, 31.) And the Gentleman at first see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to decline Antiquity, further than the Lawes of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do make mention of Tithes, and to prove them payable by Custom (but if such Custom be not good (as they have prov'd in their Treatise (<hi>Page</hi> 32.33.) the Custome of Tithes is found to be) the same is to be abolished. And for claim of them by Divine right (the Gentleman having totally disclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) he might have forborn mentioning the tax by those our friends of any for idolizing the same for no man is so mad to say that any do pay them to <hi>Im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>riators</hi> (as due by Divine Right) but as they have said in their Treatise (<hi>Page</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33673:4"/> 27, 28) at large; Tithes have come to <hi>Impropriators</hi> as <hi>Thief-stollen Goods</hi> for little, and now the True Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have found out where their goods be, the unconscionable avaritious Tith-takers would still detain them from their True Owners; and as concerning the Catalogue of Statutes which the Gentleman citeth, all of them before the Reign of K. H. the 8. are no more for <hi>Tithes</hi> than other superstitious Things abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished; and the Others since being made by Parliament (who have been accounted to do well according to their informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Iudgements) no man can imagine any other but that Tithes would have been imployed as at first intended, but now the same being discovered since to be misimployed, may not the People lawfully Petition (and not be barred as that writer would have it) for repealing and abolishing the same Acts or Ordinances, and the Legislators justly do it, and leave Tithes to the true Owners for maintenance of them and their Families in their Soules health and relief of the Poor?</p>
            <p>And though the Gentleman, as before, declined Antiquity, yet after he flieth up to <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apostata,</hi> shewing the intention of the First to murder the Preachers and Professors of the Word of God, and the Other for robbing the Spirituall persons, and laying violent hands upon the Revenue of the Church: The like danger that followed <hi>Julian,</hi> the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriators</hi> have most cause to beware of; for have not they trod in the Paths of those <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and endeavoured as much as they could to starve the Poor of the <hi>Christians</hi> in these days, and their <hi>Vicars,</hi> or <hi>Ministers,</hi> in detaining that, which is due to them for their sustenance, and mispending the same, as before we herein, and our said friends in their Treatise have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? And are not therefore such Stewards fit to be turned out of Office?</p>
            <p>And for the Antient Compositions for allowance of Vicars (being when all manner of provisions of Victuals and Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were Cheaper at lesse by 11 â parts into 12 â to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, than in these times) that, with the Maintenance of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriators or Stewards in collecting them, and Comfortable Relief of the Poor, might come somthing neer the value of such Tithes. And we beleeve, that if our Ancestors had imagined how Tithes would have been mispent, they would not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented

            <p>And as for the Continuance of time, how long, and in what manner, and by whom, and by what means Tithes have been paid, they have at Large shewed in their Treatise (<hi>Page</hi> 23, 34.) therefore no need is for us to say any more concerning that.</p>
            <p>And for the Injustice pretended to be done to <hi>Patrons</hi> in abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of Tithes, what prejudice can they receive thereby? for in Right and Equity they never ought to reap any profit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to their own uses, but only as they were bound to as a duty to procure one to take the Care of Souls, and he to take all the benefit of Tith to his own use, which was a Trouble and Charge unto the Patrons, and therefore they can have no Injustice done them in taking Tithes from them, and disposing of them to the right uses, to avoid the Temptation of the Cursed and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sinne of <hi>Symonie</hi> frequently incident to such Patrons, as they have shewed (<hi>Page</hi> 34.) in their Treatise.</p>
            <p>And as for the Benefit of the <hi>Landlords</hi> of Lands if they be eased of Tith how little that will be they have at large shewed in their Treatise, (<hi>Page</hi> 30, 33.)</p>
            <p>And as for all the Answers to the Objections stated by the Gent how slender those are plainly appeareth in their said Treatise. (<hi>Page</hi> 25, 26, 33, 34.</p>
            <p>And as to the Easiness of the Labour of Ministers in Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tithes, as the Gent. pretendeth, we say, that to those, who should and ought to be carefull in their <hi>Cures,</hi> it would be much hindrance: And for the speedy and facility of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a Stipend or Salary proposed for their Cure, they have at large expressed in their Treatise (<hi>Page</hi> 32, 36.) But as for such as have neglected their Cures, and feasted and carou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as in their Treatise, and we further now have expressed, or that have been excessive covetous, or ambitious to climb to a Bishoprick, we imagin will not be contented with any reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Salary, Stipend, or Pension, but covet still to keep drunken and vicious People about them: And divers (according to the Common use of many of such) who have gotten into fat <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> imploy'd their minds and Studies to circumvent their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33673:5"/> and to beguile them of more than the Tenth of their Corn, in beginning to take their Tale from some of the worst or least of the Cocks, Sheaves, Stacks, Shocks or heaps thereof, and in going on an end with a Number from the least, or worst, to the biggest, or best; and many times thereby (when the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman hath not been very carefull) such Priests have instead of the Tenth, booked into their Clutches the Sixth or Fifth part of the poor mans Corn; and many of such Priests have so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarded their Cure, that they have busied themselves all the time of Harvest about their Tithes; and some of them (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Doctors, and such like) have been found upon Carts loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, and have caused their Servants to cover them with Corn or Straw, when any Persons of Quality have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, or near their View: And others of them pitching or heaving Tith into Carts. And some of them have gotten to be Justices of the Peace, and other great Places, and thereby have domineered and tyrannized over their Neighbours: And others of them have principally been conversant about trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some sutes, and vexed honest men, as in their Treatise (<hi>Page</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And for the losse which the Gent. pretendeth to the present Incumbent Minister, there can be none at all, in generality to such as be good, but better allowance will be afforded; and for our parts we desire that competent allowance may be to such, (as those our friends have expressed in their Treatise (<hi>Page</hi> 33, 36.) and the Ministry not left to voluntary Collections, for then Many would pay nothing at all in that behalf.</p>
            <p>Therefore we desire all men (who Please to read the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans Treatise, and this our <hi>Reply,</hi> and that <hi>Treatise</hi> of those our Friends) to consider and judge, whether or not the Clients of this Gentleman (who imployed him about this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse) be not most fit to be stiled Ignorant, Malicious, Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, Impious, Mercilesse, Hypocrites, and come neerest to such as the Murtherers of the Professors and Ministers of God, and the despoyling them of their Dues; of all which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses we put our selves upon the Country, and the grave Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Consideration of our Supreme <hi>Legislators;</hi> praying unto the Lord of Hosts for, and hoping in him of his Guidance of them, in the way of all Godlinesse, and to do equall and speedy right in the premisses, according to his Good will and pleasure.</p>
